This is the first data analytics project done with my pod team as COOP data analytics apprentices in the Fall of 2022.
The purpose of this project was to analyze crime in New York City so that the New York City Office of Management and Budget (OMB) could effectively allocate a budget to reduce crime.


Insights:
  •	The three boroughs Staten Island, Queens, Kingsborough needed more attention.
  •	Most crimes began to rise by September and peaked in December.
Hypothesis:
  •	With the beginning of the school year, children spent most of the daytime at school and were deprived of activity, having no outlet for their energy.
Recommendation:  
  Distribute money to the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), which oversees and monitors a range of programs for young New Yorkers under contract with   local community organizations, for DYCD to distribute budget to areas that need more attention to provide indoor activities for youth.
    •	Youth are less likely to become a victim of a crime, or engage in dangerous activities if they are kept busy.
